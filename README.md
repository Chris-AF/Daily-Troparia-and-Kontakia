# Orthodox Christian Weekday Troparia and Kontakia

Created for the use of Orthodox Christians during prayer. Many prayer and service books encourage incorporating the weekday troparia and kontakia into daily prayer, but very few actually provide the text for those hymns.

This leaves laypeople reaching for an entirely separate book or an electronic device to look them up, which is distracting.

The text in this LaTeX file is formatted to be printed on a small card that can be used as a bookmark for prayer or service books, so the text of the weekday troparia and kontakia may be immediately available to those who prefer to use them.

The LaTex is formatted for a card size of 3.5" by 5". 

All are free to alter the formatting as they see fit, in accordance with the license terms.

All are free to print the text formatted here for their use, in accordance with the license terms.

Altering the text of the hymns themselves is ***strongly*** discouraged. One may not consider the text of the hymns themselves as falling under the GPLv3 license or the author's copyright.
